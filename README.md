## [Live Demo](https://leaderanalytics.com/blazor/leaderpivotdemo)

LeaderPivot.Blazor is an easy to use pivot table control for Blazor applications.  

This demo application showcases some of the features of LeaderPivot.Blazor.  It also provides a copy/paste template you can use to implement the control in your app.  Look at the [LeaderPivot.TestData repository](https://github.com/leaderanalytics/LeaderPivot.TestData) for examples of how to create `Measures` and `Dimensions`.  

* In the demo app, click the Controls button in the upper right corner of the page to customize the look of the control.  

* Dimension buttons can be dragged within an axis or across axis to re-dimension the displayed data.  Clicking a dimension buttons toggles the sort direction for that dimension.
